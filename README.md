Introduction: Domain problem characterization.
Through this dashboard, I wish for viewers to have an interactive view of the medal history of each of the countries that participated on the highest stage of atheltics, the Olympics. They can analyze the N ranked countries and athletes with the highest medal count but also view the trends in how the countries with the a high amount of snow have more athlete participating in the Winter Olympics held on a staggered 2 year schedule. 

Data/operation abstraction design:
I prepared my data first connect the data source to Tableau. Then I began the process of cleaning the data up. This included: pivoting and changing the data type. For instance, changing the "Year" from a "Number" data type to a "Date" data type. I also decided to use the split function to split the first and last names of the athletes.

Future work: What if any future work do you plan to keep on doing to improve your app.
For the future, I would also like to advance my tableau skills plan to ensure the data continues to be updated and add respective charts and maps to identify any patterns or coorelations. Data like this can definietly help forecast for the upcoming Olympic Games.
